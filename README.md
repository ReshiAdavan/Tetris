# Tetris

Back when I was in my elementary-school days and even early high-school days, adobe flash was supported and there was tons of amazing computer games made on gaming websites like miniclip.com, agame.com, etc. Me and my friends really used to like to compete with each other in Tetris and whoever achieved the highest score won. As time passed, we grew up and eventually wanted to revisit these games for nostalgic reasons. Unfortunately, this era of computer games has died because adbobe flash is no longer supported.

A lot of games were taken down from as a result of this. As devastated as I was, I was quite curious as to see how hard it would be to create my own version of Tetris. Apparently, all it took was a bit of Javascript and React.

### Features

- User-friendly controls (both WASD and arrow keys), my own personal shapes, nostalgic UI and color scheme, and display of score and levels.
- Scores are stored in a backend Mongo Database for reference. (Just so that there's legitmate proof of who has the highest score)

### Skills

- Programming languages: HTML, JavaScript, CSS
- Libraries/Frameworks: React.js, Express.js, Node.js
- Database: MongoDB
