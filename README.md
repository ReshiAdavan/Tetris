# Tetris

Back when I was a kid, adobe flash supported tons of amazing computer games on gaming websites like miniclip.com, agame.com, etc. During my free time, I would always compete with friends in Tetris to attain the highest score. As time passed, we grew up and eventually wanted to revisit these games out of nostalgia. Unfortunately, this era of computer games has died because adobe flash is no longer supported.

As devastated as I was, I was quite curious to see how hard it would be to create my own version of Tetris. Apparently, all it took was a bit of Javascript and React.

### Features

- User-friendly controls (both WASD and arrow keys), my own personal shapes, nostalgic UI and color scheme, and display of score and levels.
- Scores are stored in a backend Mongo Database for reference. (Just so that there's legitmate proof of who has the highest score)

### Skills

- Programming languages: HTML, JavaScript, CSS
- Libraries/Frameworks: React.js, Express.js, Node.js
- Database: MongoDB
